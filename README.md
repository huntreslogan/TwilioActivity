Twilio Activity
================
Activity created for a Hackbright visit to Twilio where we learned how to create a python program to send SMS with the Twilio API. The Twilio team created an entertaining workshop that included SMS based quiz and a photo app where we could send a photo and the Twilio app would respond with what was in the image. It was pretty spot-on and made for a very fun visit.
